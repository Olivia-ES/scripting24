<p>Vi is one of many characters from a variation, of a world I have created. She is not the main character, she is of the supporting cast. She does play an important role in this version of the story though. She is one of the main side characters in this world. She can be located at <b>"Logged-Inn"</b>, as this is one major places the story takes place.  </p>



<p>Logged-Inn is a small town, nestled in a much larger world. It is a very warm and cozy looking town, to any outsider looking in... Logged-Inn is run by various <b>"Transients"</b>. Transients are a small rotation of families in power. Vi comes from a family well known for their loyalty to whoever is currently in power. These secondary families are the servants, the <b>"Loyal-Ties"</b> .</p>

<p>Vi is a very silent character, because of how she was brought up. Since she was born into the most prestigous Loyal-Tie family. She was raised to uphold the families reputation. This means she went through rigorous training to become the best of the best. She has a strong sense of duty, she does not know how to have fun. She will do as she's told, as she was taught to live only to serve. Long story short she is, <b>Loyal,Obedient,Silent,Strong,Smart,Capable</b>. </p>

<p>Vi only knows one person, outside of her family. This character is the main character,<b> L version 2</b>. From now on, will be reffered to as <b>L2</b> . Vi stumbles upon L2 one day, while waiting to be assigned to serve a Transient. From that day onward Vi spends all her freetime observing L2, as she feels drawn to her. L2 soon confronts Vi and the two form an unlikely friensdship, always meeting eachother now. On the outskirts of Logged-Inn, and just before the <b>Lost Forest</b> . </p>

<p>Vi has knowledge in a variety of things, stuff which was drilled into her. She may be the most competant in tending to the needs of any Transient. She knows how to cook a variety of meals from scratch. She is very keen on housekeeping, and any trivial day to day tasks. She is well versed in fighting, so that she may defend her Transient. She is very resourceful, and has great survival knowledge. She is a great handy lady and can fix most things. </p>
