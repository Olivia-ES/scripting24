          <p>Olivia's got a best friend, her name is Nellie. Olivia has known Nellie since she was five years old. Nellie was the first one outside of Olivia's family that she interacted with. From K-5 to grade 5 they were friends, on and off as Nellie moved a lot. They became best friends in grade 6, and towards the end of middle school found out that they were cousins. Olivia and Nellie’s friendship is still going strong, 15 years. Olivia enjoys spending time by herself and has a lot of ways to keep entertained. If Olivia is not with family, or her best friend, she's most likely reading or playing games.

        <p>Grade 6 is when Olivia discovered her love for creation. She discovered YouTube, and “Minecraft Roleplays”. She was mesmerized by how people used a video game to tell stories. She then started to draw fanart of characters from the videos. She also rediscovered anime at around that time. These cool fantasy worlds are what inspired her to begin the creation of her own. At 11 years old she started to create her original characters, and a world for them</p>

        <p>Before anime Olivia always loved cartoons and animated shows. One of the shows she loves and grew up on is <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1305826/">Adventure Time!</a>  There are rare times that she draws fanart. Here is one of not many fanart pieces she has done. it is a profile picture of Prince Gumball, the genderbend of Princess Bubblegum. There were no profile pictures of him online, so she drew her own. </p>
